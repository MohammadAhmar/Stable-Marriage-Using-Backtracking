# Stable-Marriage-Using-Backtracking
The Problem: You have n men and n woman, and their preference rankings of each other, and you need to match them up so that the total matching is “stable.” The preference rankings: You are given 2 n X n arrays, mp (men’s preference) which gives the men’s ranking of the women, and wp (women’s preference) which gives the women’s ranking of the men. So mp[i][j] gives man i's ranking of woman j and likewise for the women’s ranking of the men in wp. For example in the following tables we have n=3 and the women and men are “named” 0, 1 or 2 and the raking are in the range 0 = highest, 1 second highest and 2 lowest. int mp[3][3]={0,2,1, 0,2,1, 1,2,0}; int wp[3][3]={2,1,0, 0,1,2, 2,0,1}; So man 1 assigns woman 2 the rank of 1 (i.e. second highest) and prefers woman 0 the best.
